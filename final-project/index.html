    <h1> Final Project - Daniel Uhm </h1>
    <h2> Accessibility Evaluation </h2>
    <h3> Evaluating <a href="http://research.umich.edu/leadership">U of M Research Leadership Team</a> as an Editorial</h3> </br>
    <div>
      <h4> Criteria 1. "Write good alt text for your images" </h4>
      <p> There are 16 officers and their photos, uploaded on the web page. Overall, this web page has low
          accessibility for those who use screen readers because none of the images have proper alt texts that are readable.
          If I were the designer of the website, I would include the alt text of the images such as "photo-WilliamGreer". At least
          I would mention the name of the person who is in the picture. In that way, users can understand who those images refer to.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4> Criteria 2. "Editorial Engineers: think about how custom experiences can be made accessible" </h4>
      <p> At the bottom of the page, the website contains several SVGs as a footer. One good thing about using SVGs here is that they
          have proper titles for instance, "facebook", "Twitter", "Email App" etc.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4> Criteria 3. "Be as consistent and clear as possible" </h4>
      <p> I should say this website seems to be pretty consistent and clear in three reasons.
        <ol>
          <li> It's not wordy overall </li>
          <li> It does not look busy </li>
          <li> No jargons and appropriate use of headings </li>
        </ol>
        One suggestion can be made on the right hand side where it shows the list of news spotlights about the U-M research team.
        This part might look a little wordy and time consuming for those who use screen readers. I would suggest to leave
        the title of the news as it is and remove the content of them so the web-site might look more nice and clean.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4> Criteria 4. "Links should be descriptive" </h4>
      <p> The links on the navigation bar look pretty descriptive and informative enough for the users to understand where the links
          are taking them. I do not agree that the links that say "GO" which re-direct users to biography of a specific person are
          clear enough for users to fully comprehend where the links are taking them. I should suggest to change the name of the links as
          "See Biography" or "About Kristina Ko". The name of the link should at least contain a word that indicates what kind of information
          will pop up through this link.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4> Criteria 5. "Important information should not be conveyed through images, color, or sensory characteristics alone" </h4>
      <p> Out of all the criterias, this is the most well-done part. I personally believe this web-site has balanced combination of text
          and visualized materials. For instance, it appropriately used images of people to illustrate each officer whereas, it used the
          text to describe the role of the leadership team, which is very difficult to be described using visualized materials.
